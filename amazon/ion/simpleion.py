# Academic Free License v. 2.1
# ============================
#
# Copyright (c) 2006 Bob Ippolito.  All rights reserved.
#
# This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose
# owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original
# Work:
#
# Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1
#
# 1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual,
# sublicenseable license to do the following:
#
# a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
#
# b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;
#
# c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;
#
# d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
#
# e) to display the Original Work publicly.
#
# 2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual,
# sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work
# as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.
#
# 3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making
# modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees
# to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work
# that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy
# of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by
# You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that
# information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
#
# 4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original
# Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
# Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
# grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor
# except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any
# patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor
# even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit
# Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a
# right to license.
#
# 5) This section intentionally omitted.
#
# 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright,
# patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
# descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative
# Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
# modified the Original Work.
#
# 7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work
# and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
# of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly
# stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
# and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT,
# MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH
# YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted
# hereunder except under this disclaimer.
#
# 8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
# contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
# consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including,
# without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
# commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury
# resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
# allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not
# apply to You.
#
# 9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a
# reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License.
# Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create
# Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any
# attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is
# expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty.
# Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this
# License and all of its terms and conditions.
#
# 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of
# the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or
# counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination
# provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other
# software or hardware.
#
# 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the
# courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
# the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
# Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work
# outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the
# U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. ยง 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
# section shall survive the termination of this License.
#
# 12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the
# prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
# attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section
# shall survive the termination of this License.
#
# 13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any
# provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary
# to make it enforceable.
#
# 14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an
# individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
# entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes
# of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
# entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares,
# or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
#
# 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or
# by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
#
# This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved. Permission is hereby granted to copy
# and distribute this license without modification. This license may not be modified without the express written
# permission of its copyright owner.
